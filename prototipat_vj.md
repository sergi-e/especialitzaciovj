Why prototype in video game dev: https://pinglestudio.com/blog/full-cycle-development/game-prototyping
- Only way to know if core mechanics are functional and enjoyable and what to modify to make these more fun. It is unusual fore core mechanics to change later in dev process. The earlier the better. 
- Testing before leaning into more cemented stages of the dev process. 
- It is also a space for idea generation. Don't be rigid with core concepts and let it flow. 
- There are analogic and digital prototypes. 
- It is not about the visuals but testing mechancis and functions, refine core. 
- List of questions to answer and tick as you go. 
- Doesn't take much time. Core mechanics only take few days or a week to make. 
- 1. Define goals of prototype 2. Narrow core mechanics to small set (2-3). 3. Draw the plan 4. Present it and collect for feedback 5. Address feedback  6. Create prototype 7. 2nd round of feedback 8. Add more mechanics to test and repeat steps. 
--> Document this process. 
- Paper prototyping: show on paper how everything works. 
- Wireframe prototyping: defines UI, HUD, set-piece mechanics and non-playable assets. 
- Greybox prototyping: test mechanics and physics without assets in place. 2D/3D shapes attached. 
- Rapid prototyping: increasingly more complex prototypes in quick succession. Small increments in functions that quickly raise in quality. It is against the slow feedback, plan... idea
- Horizon Zero Dawn 12 months of prototyping with extensive documentation to refine concepts while staying on course. 

Prototype Part 1: https://www.videogameworkshop.com/game-dev/Prototype-Your-Game.html
- Heavy Iron Studios: "Everyone has an idea for a game. If you want people to take you seriously, make a prototype". 
- Prevents sinking money into bad ideas. 
- 2016 GDC Julian Gollop, lead designer in X-COM said his GDD was very poorly received, failed to present the idea and generated lots of confusion. Project almost cancelled had it not been for the prototype. 
- Some prototypes are bound to fail, and that is okay. They can also give lots of new ideas, not only discard games. 
- Paper prototype: zero code. Can be changed while tested. Interactive. --> Spore. Also very good at testing UI. Also games like FF, Pokemon and other dice/probability based games. Even FPS, be creative --> The art of game design: a book of lenses. Check also board versions of games.
- DIfficult to prototype games based on quick actions (not impossible). 
Wireframe Prototype Part 2: https://www.videogameworkshop.com/game-dev/Prototype-Your-Game-Part2.html
- Wireframe = Static fidelity representation of final product. What a blueprint is to a building. 
- Wireframe != Mock ups --> Mock up = higher fidelity. Wireframe use low fidelity drawings meant to be replaced. 
- Wireframe can provide a lot of information about the game concepts and mechanics with no need to interact with them.
- Linking wireframes can make a working prototype. Tools: mockfow, go-mockingbird, even slides or comics (Harmonix's 2016 GDC Talk). 
Greybox Prototype Part 3: https://www.videogameworkshop.com/game-dev/Prototype-Your-Game-Part3.html
- get something playable without producing assets. Basic shapes as stand-in. 
- Popular to test game mechanics and level design. 
- Effective because: 1. Easy to share 2. Play test immediately 3. iterated quickly (when well done). 
- SUper Mario 64 started greybox. Miyamoto spent months moving Mario inside a test room. No other assets created, key was movement. 
- If mechanic relies on physics you'll need game. Also to test things like emergent complexity (rocket-jump) or test changes. 
- Braid & Alien Isolation started as prototypes. 
- Really fast way to test level design. Lenght of platforms, AI, camera angles... > Kirby's adventure.

- Day 1: gameplay ideas, gray-boxing levels, art team ramping up concepts...
- Fast but not ugly. Communicate only what you need to
- Grey box skeleton and paintbucket. 
- Communicate the essential verbs. Focus on those. 
- Get help from FX, audio, etc. It saves much animation time. 
- Be sure to communicate what you are intended to. 
- Keep it simple, not distracting.
- Getting outsource assets will not make it consistent. 
- Be excited about redoing over and over. Not everyone suited. 
- For this, it is good to be generalist.

Why prototype in video game dev: https://pinglestudio.com/blog/full-cycle-development/game-prototyping
- Only way to know if core mechanics are functional and enjoyable and what to modify to make these more fun. It is unusual fore core mechanics to change later in dev process. The earlier the better. 
- Testing before leaning into more cemented stages of the dev process. 
- It is also a space for idea generation. Don't be rigid with core concepts and let it flow. 
- There are analogic and digital prototypes. 
- It is not about the visuals but testing mechancis and functions, refine core. 
- List of questions to answer and tick as you go. 
- Doesn't take much time. Core mechanics only take few days or a week to make. 
- 1. Define goals of prototype 2. Narrow core mechanics to small set (2-3). 3. Draw the plan 4. Present it and collect for feedback 5. Address feedback  6. Create prototype 7. 2nd round of feedback 8. Add more mechanics to test and repeat steps. 
--> Document this process. 
- Paper prototyping: show on paper how everything works. 
- Wireframe prototyping: defines UI, HUD, set-piece mechanics and non-playable assets. 
- Greybox prototyping: test mechanics and physics without assets in place. 2D/3D shapes attached. 
- Rapid prototyping: increasingly more complex prototypes in quick succession. Small increments in functions that quickly raise in quality. It is against the slow feedback, plan... idea
- Horizon Zero Dawn 12 months of prototyping with extensive documentation to refine concepts while staying on course. 

Prototype Part 1: https://www.videogameworkshop.com/game-dev/Prototype-Your-Game.html
- Heavy Iron Studios: "Everyone has an idea for a game. If you want people to take you seriously, make a prototype". 
- Prevents sinking money into bad ideas. 
- 2016 GDC Julian Gollop, lead designer in X-COM said his GDD was very poorly received, failed to present the idea and generated lots of confusion. Project almost cancelled had it not been for the prototype. 
- Some prototypes are bound to fail, and that is okay. They can also give lots of new ideas, not only discard games. 
- Paper prototype: zero code. Can be changed while tested. Interactive. --> Spore. Also very good at testing UI. Also games like FF, Pokemon and other dice/probability based games. Even FPS, be creative --> The art of game design: a book of lenses. Check also board versions of games.
- DIfficult to prototype games based on quick actions (not impossible). 
Wireframe Prototype Part 2: https://www.videogameworkshop.com/game-dev/Prototype-Your-Game-Part2.html
- Wireframe = Static fidelity representation of final product. What a blueprint is to a building. 
- Wireframe != Mock ups --> Mock up = higher fidelity. Wireframe use low fidelity drawings meant to be replaced. 
- Wireframe can provide a lot of information about the game concepts and mechanics with no need to interact with them.
- Linking wireframes can make a working prototype. Tools: mockfow, go-mockingbird, even slides or comics (Harmonix's 2016 GDC Talk). 
Greybox Prototype Part 3: https://www.videogameworkshop.com/game-dev/Prototype-Your-Game-Part3.html
- get something playable without producing assets. Basic shapes as stand-in. 
- Popular to test game mechanics and level design. 
- Effective because: 1. Easy to share 2. Play test immediately 3. iterated quickly (when well done). 
- SUper Mario 64 started greybox. Miyamoto spent months moving Mario inside a test room. No other assets created, key was movement. 
- If mechanic relies on physics you'll need game. Also to test things like emergent complexity (rocket-jump) or test changes. 
- Braid & Alien Isolation started as prototypes. 
- Really fast way to test level design. Lenght of platforms, AI, camera angles... > Kirby's adventure. 

GDC animation prototyping: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-zKMzboOec
- Day 1: gameplay ideas, gray-boxing levels, art team ramping up concepts...
- Fast but not ugly. Communicate only what you need to
- Grey box skeleton and paintbucket. 
- Communicate the essential verbs. Focus on those. 
- Get help from FX, audio, etc. It saves much animation time. 
- Be sure to communicate what you are intended to. 
- Keep it simple, not distracting.
- Getting outsource assets will not make it consistent. 
- Be excited about redoing over and over. Not everyone suited. 
- For this, it is good to be generalist. 

Principles: https://lvictorino.com/blog/what-is-a-prototype.html
**- Size matters:** prototype != Alpha. Small and ugly, look for the very core. 
**- Timing is essential:** don't exhaust resources. 
**- Don't be perfect, be efficient:** pre-production starts after the prototyping, so don't overthink nor polish. 
**- Don't add:** you will fall in the eternal prototyping pit. 
**- You will do everything twice:** the prototype goes to trash, we don't build on top of it. Then we will rebuild with knowledge and solidly. 

Prototype vs alpha: https://ppolsinelli.medium.com/what-is-a-game-prototype-506472ec67ad
**- Prototype is based on design by substraction.** Sometimes people say "bring me a prototype" meaning an alpha of the game, which requires much more effort. Metaphor of the Space Shuttle. 

Laws of prototyping: https://creatinggames.press.plymouth.edu/chapter/the-design-process-prototyping/
- Playable form quickly and cheaply as possible. 
- Especially important for design-risk ideas, not clone-and-tweak. 
**- 4 steps per iteration:** design, prototyping, playtesting, evaluation.
**- Corollary:** reduce time required in each iteration as much as possible. 
**- How to save time:** schedule and plan playtest to save up explanations and spare time. Evaluation does not take long, yes/no, good/bad, done/tbd actions. Reduce time spent creating the prototype. Don't rush creativity. 
**- On prototypes:** build as fast as possible. Cut corners. Ugly and cheap. Build only what necessary to evaluate. Make it easy to change. 
**- Prototyping in paper/analog:** cheap, fast, easy to change, no guilt on throwing away, useful for most gameplay systems, imperative to design systems to make it playable (not "50 cards undefined" stuff). 
**- Limitations of paper/analog:** Bad for dexterity or time based mechanics. Difficult to represent hidden information (fog of war?). Complex non automatized calculations can drag on the process (excel) --> be careful with designing complex systems, maybe the game isn't that fun (Sid Meier, Civilization). Not eye-candy (not a bad thing in a prototype). Not well suited to test UI, as it is static. 
**- Prototyping realtime systems:** translate to board games with time based turns. Twitch mechanics such as dodging based on accuracy can be translated to random (as it is random from the opponent's perspective). Create a grid, though not high fidelity with game. 
**- Notes about grids:** grids of squares are casual, familiar and easy to navigate. Diagonal movement becomes a problem. Hexes make it easier for diagonal but more difficult to create obstacles as movement is far less constrained. Also not so familiar. Open area board use tap measure to move. Freedom of movement but not familiar and susceptible to accidents and measurement fights.
**- Adding features VS KISS:** start with just core. If this doesn't work, adding will not make it work. More rules over a unstable foundation could obscure the problems. Everytime you want to add, ask yourself if it is necessary. Let laziness override creativity. It is hard to leave things at the bare minimum. Make a list of items and cross of as many as possible. Ask other designers not attached to the idea. Everytime you add, add just ONE feature and playtest. Resist adding more. As in programming, add one thing and unit test. Accept that this process may not be particularly fun but tedious.

- Phil Harrison (Atari president): "experiment earlier, fail more often, and fail more cheaply"

https://www.gamesindustry.biz/phil-harrison-is-right-about-prototyping-says-betteridge
- Mark Betteridge (programmer and executive at Rare, 2008) agrees and says proottype earlier. Prototype easy and quick. I don't care about a piece of paper, implementation matters. Rapid-prototype a number of ideas to find out which works better. Take the best ideas to core production. Publishers stay too much on safe franchise strategies. Have 100 ideas, prototype the best dozen, develop the best 3. 

Core loops (Based on Dan Spaventa): https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/how-supporting-core-loops-and-early-prototyping-are-key-to-your-game-s-success
- Gameplay through which entire game is built. Minute to minute player interaction, most repeated set of actions, enablement of progress. TEST AND FLESH THIS. Find weak links and address these with minimal waste. 
- Core loop is critical > if not fun, game not fun. all other game systems build on it. First thing to prototype. 
- Anything you add should be designed to improve a part of the core loop. 
- Don't create competing systems in a core loop, that distracts players. 
- What to prototype: core loop, UI/UX, Unique game mechanics and Game rules. 
- Digital prototypes make easier to identify technical problems, as they arise. 
- Playtest the prototype: Iron out edge cases and ambigual gameplay, listen to everybody's feedback. Tested by devs and players. Iterate. 

https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/keep-or-kill-3-design-features-to-test-during-prototyping
- Play with camera angles to enhance clarity of gameplay
- Minimize FOMO (fear of missing out), 
- Prototype phase of casual game no more than 2/3 weeks. 

https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/why-and-how-to-use-video-game-prototyping/
WIREFRAME:
- Wireframe are staple for UX designers. 
- Low-fidelity meant to provide a better understanding. Accurately relay relationship between elements: menus, loading screens, conversations, pokemon-esque battles... and other static things. 
- Use a frame for scale and placement. 
- Define types of characters, UI/HUD, and SOME mechanics.
- Can be created using slides or UX tools. 
GREYBOX:
- Adds physics and test the emerging complexity. 
- Wireframe and mock ups are meant to show how it looks like. Greybox is meant to show how it feels like. 
- Start using the tools you will use to develop. 
- You can script dynamic actions. 
- Rapid prototyping: rapidly going from one prototype to a slightly higher fidelity one in a short period of time. 

https://www.gamedeveloper.com/disciplines/how-to-prototype-a-game-in-under-7-days
- Experimental Gameplay Project > World of Goo (7 days, 1 student) > Prototype as many new forms of gameplay as possible. 
1. Rapid is a state of mind. Rapid prototyping more than just a useful tool in pre-production, way of life. Embrace risk-taking and failure. Enforce short dev cycles. Any gameplay idea can be prototyped in less than one week, some 1 day. No correlation between time spent and successful game. Constraints (such as themes) enforce creativity. Game design is paramount. When creating different prototypes, work in parallel, only share at the beginning and end. 
2. Myth of brainstorming: cannot schedule creativity. At least it makes everybody thinking (which can boost creativity later). It is useful when there is something specific to tackle or talk about. Alternative: gather music and concept art. Simulate in your head, draw, save time. 
3. Development, nobody cares: start with core mechanics. Correct is not best, if cannot get it, fake it. Cut losses by shooting baby in the crib. Players are smart, nothing salvages bad design (not fun) --> however, it makes it better. Great engineering != Great prototype, reusable code does not make it better. 
4. General gameplay: complexity != fun. Some kind of creation/customization helps replayability. Experimental != complex. Build toward a gameplay goal. Make it juicy, responsive to input and world. 

Master clas by Will Wright (Spore, SimCity, The Sims...): https://www.masterclass.com/articles/will-wrights-tips-for-successful-prototyping-in-video-games
- Digital allows to easily tweak variables. 
- You need practice to prototype. Take notes, answer questions, pay attention to fun, learn and move on. Quick and cheap. 

Prototyping tips: https://departmentofplay.net/7-tips-for-successful-video-game-prototyping/
- Build only what necessary, hack around features: a wireframe can represent something to complex or out-of-scope, automate or fake what is unnecessary, explain as they play, use videos and visual backdrops. 
- In Unity, create base project that can be reused having: basic game logic such as UI, level changes, sound. Asset packs, mobile functions (notifications, etc), analytics and ads SDKs. 

Prototyping Sims 3: https://www.gamesindustry.biz/prototyping-the-sims-3
- Different types of prototypes: some to seek solutions and others not directly related to the game sometimes, but to stirr conversations. Distilling things can be tedious, but it should turn into something fun. Do what feels good and fun for the player (tidy mechanic). They also did prototypes to affect players feelings (hateful sim). 

Formal reasons and tips to prototype: https://www.masterclass.com/articles/how-to-make-and-test-a-prototype
- Reasons: 1. test ux, 2. facilitates market research, 3. improves final design, 4. spark other ideas. 
- Tips: 1. Do a patent search to look for similar projects, 2. Sign NDAs, 3. be cost effective. 4. Existe el out-sourcing.

The rapid prototyping game by Matt Smith: https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/the-rapid-prototyping-game
- Reference: Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design: An Encyclopedia of Mechanisms by Geoffrey Engelstein and Isaac Shalev. 
- Rapid prototyping methodology: 
1. Dice categories (throw dice): 
- Game Medium (board game, card game, etc.)
- Game Format (competitive, cooperative, etc.)
- Game Objective (exploration, building, etc.)
2. Element decks (pull card): 
3. Reflection > Another deck witch questions to start covnersations. 
4. Iteration > deck that forces changes: new mechanic, additional victory condition, change turns... Frustrating
